# The Monkees!
In my project I have created a stylish, user-friendly, responsive-design orientated and frontend–only website for a 1960’s rock band called “The Monkees”. 
The website I have created for this band was influenced by bold colours and fashion of the 1960’s, however with a clean cut modern look. Giving this website all the iconic nostalgia of the Monkees that fans adore but all the practical modern functionality that they love too, provoking a positive emotional response from users every time they visit the site.    
There are five pages that make-up the website, each unique and providing a convenient service to the user while being consistent in design, practicality and the required specifications of the client. 
Each page greets you with the recognisable Monkees guitar logo as the home button on an easy to use navigation bar. As the user explores all the content on the website they will be greeted by classic pictures of the band upon loading each page, marking that page as different to the others in its function.  This website respects the past pop-culture of the Monkees bit giving the band all the modern functionality to remain current. This website fulfils the current needs of the Monkees, for example, having “sign up and subscribe” forms and social media tabs. Ensuring the band can maintain their communication with fans old and new. 
Its Pages display welcoming images of the band, as the “Home” page that gives a clear overview of the website and easy to navigate navbar for users to switch between pages. “News” page where fans can find out all the latest updates from the Monkees. “Listen” page where uses can hear recent podcasts and guest stars of the Monkees, listening to all the behind the scenes stories and experiences of the band. Watch and listen to the best music videos produced by the Monkees on “Music video” page, where users can stream their catalogue of music. Finally the site has “events and bookings” page where enquiries into private bookings can be made not to mention upcoming tour dates and ticket purchasing.
