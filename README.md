# The Monkees!

In my project I have created a stylish, user-friendly, responsive-design orientated and frontend–only website for a 1960’s rock band called “The Monkees”. 
The website I have created for this band was influenced by bold colours and fashion of the 1960’s, however with a clean cut modern look. Giving this website all the iconic nostalgia of the Monkees that fans adore but all the practical modern functionality that they love too, provoking a positive emotional response from users every time they visit the site.    

There are five pages that make-up the website, each unique and providing a convenient service to the user while being consistent in design, practicality and the required specifications of the client. 
Each page greets you with the recognisable Monkees guitar logo as the home button on an easy to use navigation bar. As the user explores all the content on the website they will be greeted by classic pictures of the band upon loading each page, marking that page as different to the others in its function.  This website respects the past pop-culture of the Monkees bit giving the band all the modern functionality to remain current. This website fulfils the current needs of the Monkees, for example, having “sign up and subscribe” forms and social media tabs. Ensuring the band can maintain their communication with fans old and new. 

Its Pages display welcoming images of the band, as the “Home” page that gives a clear overview of the website and easy to navigate navbar for users to switch between pages. “News” page where fans can find out all the latest updates from the Monkees. “Listen” page where uses can hear recent podcasts and guest stars of the Monkees, listening to all the behind the scenes stories and experiences of the band. Watch and listen to the best music videos produced by the Monkees on “Music video” page, where users can stream their catalogue of music. Finally the site has “events and bookings” page where enquiries into private bookings can be made not to mention upcoming tour dates and ticket purchasing. 

## UX

The purpose of this project was to create a static website (front-end only) for a 1960’s rock band who are still touring and performing live music today at numerous events and venues around the world. The target audience for this created website are fans, old and new of The Monkees, fans who want to see music videos and listen to podcasts from their back catalogue, find out latest news, see tour dates and make bookings, along with any new material. 

To make sure the target audience accomplished these things when visiting my website, I implemented the following: 

- Home page: Providing an overview of the whole website for visitors, links to social media presence, brief “about us” section, well know nostalgic video and short list of upcoming dates with link to events and bookings. 
- Sign up form on every page: Button located on every page in the header with follow and subscribe in the footer, idea being fans will stay updated with all news and updates of upcoming events. 
- News page: All the latest news about the band and its members for fans to read up on and remain informed. 
- Listen page: This is a collection of podcasts staring the The Monkees and some special guests. 
- Music Video page: Full videos where fans can watch and listen to the most iconic Monkees songs from their catalogue. 
- Events and Bookings page: Where fans can see current and upcoming tour dates and make requests for bookings. 
- Social media links: For users to follow to stay up to date with any news the band may have.

If you have noticed I have been particular about the colour scheme of the website, I wanted it to match the colours used by the band. Another detail is a unique image of the band on each page relating to that page. The use of logos and images throughout the website is to provoke a positive emotional response from its users, giving a good overall experience and being easy on the eye.
